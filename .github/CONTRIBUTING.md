Contributing
------------

The best way to collaborate with the project contributors is through the Golden Software
organization on GitHub: <https://github.com/GoldenSoftwareLtd>.

You are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we
are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as
fast as we can.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a GitHub
issue, especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors
a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design,
and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.

If you want to raise an issue such as a defect or an enhancement request please open a GitHub issue for the appropriate project.  Please keep the following in mind:
- Try to reduce your code to the bare minimum required to reproduce the issue.
- If we can't reproduce the issue, we can't fix it. Please list the exact steps required to reproduce the issue.

We review issues and pull requests on a weekly basis (sometimes more frequent).
When we require more information from you, we'll ask.  In order to keep the
issue and pull request clean, we ask that you respond within **one week** or we'll
close the issue pending your response.

After an issue is created or a pull request is submitted, contributors and/or
maintainers will offer feedback. If the pull request passes review, a maintainer
will accept it with a comment.

When a pull request for code contributions fails testing, the author is
expected to update the pull request to address the failure until it
passes testing and the pull request merges successfully.

At least one review from a maintainer is required for all patches.

Submitting Code Pull Requests
-----------------------------

We encourage and support contributions from the community. No fix is too
small. We strive to process all pull requests as soon as possible and
with constructive feedback. If your pull request is not accepted at
first, please try again after addressing the feedback you received.

To make a pull request you will need a GitHub account. For help, see
GitHub's documentation on forking and pull requests.

All pull requests with code should include tests that validate your
change.
